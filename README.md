# Unit Converter

This Application is created for science teachers who are as comfortable using the command line as they are using a browser. In their “Unit Conversion” science unit, they want to assign students unit-conversion problems on paper worksheets. After students turn in their completed worksheet, the teachers want to be able to enter the questions and student responses into a computer to be graded. Students will convert:
temperatures between Kelvin, Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Rankine
volumes between liters, tablespoons, cubic-inches, cups, cubic-feet, and gallons
